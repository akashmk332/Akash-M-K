          noodle, a cooked egg-and-flour paste prominent in European and Asian cuisine, 
          generally distinguished from pasta by its elongated ribbonlike form. Noodles are
           commonly used to add body and flavour to broth soups. They are commonly boiled or sautéed and
           served with sauces and meats or baked in casseroles.

Asian noodles are made primarily from starch ingredients 
other than flour, although the recipes for some Asian pan-fried
 and stir-fried dishes allow the substitution of wheat-flour noodles 
 for the Chinese mein. Noodles made from rice flour or the starch of 
 the mung bean are softened in water and then boiled and drained in preparation 
 for being fried or added to soups.
